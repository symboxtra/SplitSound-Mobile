# SplitSound-Mobile
We're  in the endgame now...

## Instructions-*read before yelling at me*
The first step is to either have Xcode installed or Android Studio, depending which one you want to work on.

Then, install the react-native cli by running
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```
Then, to run the application,
```
cd ./you/know/how/to/do/this/SplitSound-Mobile

react-native run-ios OR react-native run-android
```
*Note: the android emulator has to already be running for the run command to work for android. If you want, you can also connect your phone to your compooter to run it on that. I've yet to find a way to do that on iOS though.*
